# Opencore-T470s

I'm creating this repository for those who might be trying to Hackintosh a computer that is similar to mine. I will continue to update the repository every few weeks/months as I improve my ACPI and Kext loadout. 

Currently running 10.5.6 Catalina on OC 0.5.9

Currently functioning:

1. All basic functions including sleep/wake and boot without error 
2. Trackpoint and Trackpad with gesture support and Keypad buttons function as well
3. Touchscreen
4. Cardreader
5. USB type A ports

Untested

1. BT/Wifi - My card is on order and I will update the system with appropriate Kexts once it is delivered. 


**Note on Keyboard Shortcuts
With the use of software called Thinkpad Assistant along with associated ACPI files I've been able to get much functionality out of shortcut keys such as volume control and brightness control. This is still a work in progress and will not be updated along with the repo, please google the software if you are interested.
